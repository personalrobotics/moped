Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Where do the headers get installed?
-----------------------------------

Its easiest to find this location using this Python code snippet::

    from imp import find_module
    file, pathname, descr = find_module("pyublas")
    from os.path import join
    return join(pathname, "..", "include")

Since PyUblas requires numpy, you'll need a similar snippet for that, too::

    from imp import find_module
    file, pathname, descr = find_module("numpy")
    from os.path import join
    return join(pathname, "core", "include")

What about 0-dimensional arrays?
--------------------------------

0-dimensional arrays are supported by PyUblas, they can be converted
to :ctype:`numpy_vector` instances of length 1.

.. _faq-overload-failure:

My wrapped function is not found by Boost.Python. Help!
-------------------------------------------------------

Even if you heed all the advice in :ref:`frompython`, Boost.Python
will sometimes still complain that no valid overload can be found.
Common reasons include:

* You expect to be handling a float array, but you actually got an int (or
  different dtype) array. To be consistent, PyUblas will not copy-and-cast in
  this situation. If necessary, use :func:`numpy.asarray` in your Python code.
  (I'm debating whether to add C++ syntax to say "copying is ok here". If you
  have input, let me know.)

* If converting a matrix, the row/column-major setting may not match what Ublas
  is expecting. By default, :ctype:`numpy_matrix` is row-major, as is :class:`numpy.array`
  when creating a 2D array.

The function :func:`pyublas.why_not` can help you debug these cases.

.. _speed-faq:

Gaah! Why is this garbage so slow?
----------------------------------

Ok, let's substantiate this discussion somehwat. I've obtained
the following numbers using :file:`test/strided_speed.py` on my
1.7GHz Pentium M. You can run that file yourself for comparison.

PyUblas with Boost.Ublas in its default configuration obtains the
following speeds::

    test_ublas_speed: 0.023819s
    test_unstrided_speed: 0.152608s
    test_strided_speed: 0.234522s

All these tests measure a certain number of large in-place
vector-scalar multiplications. The assumption is that performance
for most other vector-vector operations will be very similar.

``test_ublas_speed`` measures the performance of that operation for
:ctype:`boost::numeric::ublas::vector`, ``test_unstrided_speed`` for
:ctype:`numpy_vector`, and ``test_strided_speed`` for 
:ctype:`numpy_strided_vector`. Now, you'll say, that's scary, because, 
unlike what's promised :ref:`here <indexing-speed>`, the unstrided
:ctype:`numpy_vector` actually is about an order of magnitude slower
than native Ublas. This is due to the fact that Ublas uses indexed
access for dense vector/matrix operations by default.

This default can be changed, however, by defining
:cmacro:`BOOST_UBLAS_USE_ITERATING`, in which case the timings
are pretty much as promised::

    test_ublas_speed: 0.031008s
    test_unstrided_speed: 0.034083s
    test_strided_speed: 0.205794s

If you configure PyUblas with :option:`--use-iterators`, it will
define :cmacro:`BOOST_UBLAS_USE_ITERATING` while it is being compiled.
Note however that you still need to define this macro when compiling
your own code.

.. note:: 

    Unfortunately, Boost 1.35 shipped with code that breaks when
    :cmacro:`BOOST_UBLAS_USE_ITERATING` is defined. I have submitted a `patch
    <http://lists.boost.org/MailArchives/ublas/2008/07/2872.php>`_ to the Ublas
    folks to fix this.
 
The final question is, then, why ``test_strided_speed`` is still about
an order of magnitude slower than the other two. The answer is that
Ublas will always use indexing access in
:ctype:`boost::numeric::vector_slice`, from which
:ctype:`numpy_strided_vector` is derived.

User-visible Changes
====================

PyUblas 0.93
------------

* Negative strides are supported. Slice handling was cleaned up and should be 
  correct now.

* :class:`invalid_ok` was added.

* :class:`numpy_strided_vector` was added as another way of transparently dealing
  with non-contiguous slices.

* :cfunc:`numpy_vector::min_stride` is gone. It was ill-specified and not capable
  of doing what it promised to do.

* :mod:`numpy` forces every C/C++ module that uses its functionality to call
  :cfunc:`import_array`. PyUblas has a clever mechanism that does this for you.
  This mechanism was not correct previously, it would often fail when a 
  particular piece of code was not inlined.

Acknowledgements
================

PyUblas lives through contributions from users like you! The following
people have been kind enough to contribute their changes back to PyUblas:

* Neal Becker provided lots of feedback and a good bit of code.
* Bryan Silverthorn added :ctype:`strided_vector` to-Python conversion.
* Joshua Napoli made PyUblas compatible with MSVC and made PyUblas buildable
  with Boost.Build.

Thanks to all of you! (Any omission here? If so, please let me know.)
